# Fast_Food_Restaurant_Management
 This project is about implementing a fast food restaurant management for users to search, order or even book tables in restaurant using an application. People sometimes just visit the application to see the menu card, price list and facilities. Our application helps a user to see the different kinds of menu categorized by the management of restaurant. The user can even order food items by selecting them by their own and even can see the billing side by side. An advantage of using my application is a user has security provided by asking him/her a username and password assigned to them when they came first int the restaurant every time they login to our application. When a user login successfully he/she is able to see the main page of application where the user can navigate according to its choice, can see menu showing different categories as vegetarian, non-vegetarian, desserts(ice-cream), drinks (tea, coffee, Coke etc.) by clicking on the required button on the page.
